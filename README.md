# Image-Classification-with-Keras

This project aims to get more familiar with `Keras` and `TensorFlow` libraries to build a neural network model for predicting the type of animal in a given image using the `Oregon Wildlife` dataset, including four categories, namely `elk`, `raven`, `bald_eagle` and `raccoon`.
### Objectives
- Preprocessing, including grayscaling the images and one-hot encoding of labels
- Neural network implementation
- Data classification and evaluation of the impacts of optimizer, number of epochs, loss function, and regularization
- Dimensionality reduction for data visualization
